## Codecon Docker and Docker-compose

This is a repo with the codes from Codecon's Docker and Docker-compose workshop.

This is a wordpress aplication, but you need to download the wordpress and create a file called `wordpress` in the root folder with all of the wordpress files in it, so that `docker-compose up` command work.

Any doubts you can create a issue o call me in my e-mail and i will help you to re-create this environment in your machine.
